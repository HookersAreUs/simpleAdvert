Basically is designed for QOL while lowballing and has small gui features
Be careful while using it in big lobbies, as it may crash your game

# Usage of commands
/advert *put message here* , *amount of times you want it to say it* , *how many hubs you want it to be in*
This mod is an extension of Apec GUI, so use /apec to enable or disable some of the commands
